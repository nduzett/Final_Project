# Final Project

#### What is our problem?
Every year during March Madness, millions of brackets are filled out and submitted with the hope of correctly predicting the outcome of tournament games. The American Gaming Association estimated that 70 million brackets would be filled out to total $10.4 billion overall in bets in 2017.<sup>1</sup> However, no one has predicted all the games in the tournament perfectly. This is a perfect problem to attempt to solve with machine learning, and it has been done before by Alex Tran and Adam Ginzberg at Stanford University in 2014.<sup>2</sup> Our goal will be to create a machine learning algorithm that, at a minimum, performs better than the best bracket submitted by a human, and hopefully will predict the entire tournament correctly.

#### What data will we use?
Following the example of Alex Tran and Adam Ginzberg, we will scrape ESPN for the tournament game data for the last few years of March Madness and for specific features related to each team in the tournament.

#### Outline for how we will solve the problem: preprocessing steps, models, etc.
Our approach will be centered around classification algorithms such as logistic regression. We will need to identify a cost or score function. As an example, Tran and Ginzberg use a score function:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Score&space;=&space;10&space;*&space;2^{round&space;-&space;1}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Score&space;=&space;10&space;*&space;2^{round&space;-&space;1}" title="Score = 10 * 2^{round - 1}" /></a>

Using this function weights correct predictions in later rounds higher than correct predictions in earlier rounds, since an incorrect prediction in early rounds can ruin a whole bracket.

Tran and Ginzberg lament that the issue with their project was the lack of data; at their time, only four years of detailed ESPN data were available. Now that the amount of available detailed data has doubled, perhaps our model can perform better. Cross validation will likely yield better hyperparameters (since there are more tournaments to implement as folds), variance will likely be lower, etc.
We plan to attempt to build on the work of Tran and Ginzberg by obtaining more data from additional tournament years and scraping additional team features. For example, Tran and Ginzberg suggest that finding more qualitative features on individual players, teams, programs, and coaches may be useful.
